Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard

1. Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard designed to empower management and operational teams with critical insights into the company's financial and commercial performance. The dashboard provides a quick yet deep dive into factors influencing profitability and sales trends.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard prominently displays four key performance indicators at the top, offering an immediate snapshot of the financial health:

    Total Sales: 20M

    COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): 9.96M

    Total Profit: 9.92M

    Profitability: $\text{49.9%}$

3. Key Analytical Components

a. Profit and Total Sales by Year

    Type: A line chart illustrating the annual trends of Total Sales and Total Profit from 2013 to 2016.

    Insight: Clearly shows a significant decline in both sales and profits in 2016 compared to previous years, indicating an area requiring further investigation.

b. Sum of Profit and Sum of Quantity by Stock Item

    Type: A horizontal bar chart comparing the profit generated and the quantity sold for each stock item.

    Insight: Helps identify the most profitable products (e.g., "20 mm Dou...") and items that sell in large quantities but might have relatively lower profit margins.

c. Sales by State

    Type: A detailed data table presenting performance metrics at the state level.

    Metrics Displayed: State/Province, Total Sales, Sum of Quantity, Sales Performers (e.g., bravo, amazig, poor), Sum of Profit.

    Insight: Identifies top and bottom-performing states, such as California (highest sales) and Hawaii (lowest sales and profitability). It also highlights the performance evaluation of sales teams in each region.

4. Interactive Filters

The interactive filters enable users to drill down into specific details and change the context of the displayed data. You can filter by:

    Employee

    Customer

    City

    Buying Group

    Sales Territory
